                <li>Changed the edit/disable mode button from being visible on mobile only to always visible (so the

            <ul>
                <li>Added input navigation for resource tables, can use either Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Shift+Enter or
                    Ctrl+Arrows to navigate between inputs</li>
                <li>Added the ability to set sections in the character modal to predefined presets, clicking on the

                <li>Adjusted order of school mats on resource modal, to match default ingame sort</li>
                <li>Changed validation behaviour for target inputs, now sanitises the target to match current upon
                    moving focus from the input</li>
                <li>Changed sanitising behaviour when the value in an input is too long, now just blocks extra input
                    instead of setting to max value</li>
                <li>Updated the visuals of the character modal, it also expands to take full screen width on small
                    devices now instead of 80% width</li>
                <li>Added temporary tooltip on section labels and character boxes, to inform about ctrl+click to
                    disable, and presets</li>
                <li>Adjusted star colouring for displaying target star/ue on main screen, now dims target stars instead
                    of using separate colour</li>
